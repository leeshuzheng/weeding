            Same tbh. So we’re keeping it open, come when you want, leave when you need. It’s meant to be enjoyable and
            non-anxiety inducing for you (and us)

            <b className="!font-semibold">Programme</b>
            <br />
            Free and easy, it’s really just a hangout. We’ll probably say a few words midway through the night but
            that’s about it

            We’re keeping this intimate, so it’ll be invite-only and adults-only. Appreciate you helping us keep things
            cosy

            No expectations. We see angbaos as traditional tokens of love and blessings, and not as a bill to settle.
            Any gesture is appreciated, but definitely not tied to the value of our friendship

            <br />
            There’ll be bar bites and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Let us know if you have any allergies.
            The Projector is not halal certified, but does not use any pork or lard in their food. Let us know if there
            are any issues!

            We’re not planning to have a frat rager, so keep it classy(ish) and please only vape discreetly and puke
            neatly :) Don’t get us into trouble...
